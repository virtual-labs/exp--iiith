For a very brief overview of the Merkle-Damgard transform and the design of HMAC from fixed length collision resistant hash function, click [here](docs/Collision Resistant Hash Functions.pdf)

In our experiments, instead of using a full-fledged collsion resistant hash function h, we have replaced it with a "dummy" function h. You are asked to assume collision resistance about the given function h and use it to design HMAC
